## Tired of Information Overload? Build Your Own News Dashboard!

In today's fast-paced world, staying informed can feel like drinking from a firehose. News comes at us from all angles, and it's easy to get overwhelmed. That's where the **Personal News Hub** comes in! This project lets you create a customized news aggregator, tailored to your specific interests.

## What is the Personal News Hub?

The Personal News Hub is a Python-based web application that gathers news from various sources, including:

* **Reddit:** From subreddits like `ArtificialInteligence`, `programming`, and `MachineLearning`.
* **ArXiv:** For cutting-edge AI and machine learning research papers.
* **RSS Feeds:** From popular tech news sites like TechCrunch, Wired, and more.

It then organizes this information into a clean, searchable dashboard, allowing you to:

* Filter news by time period, category, and source.
* Search for specific topics.
* Explore popular tags.
* View statistics on news trends.
